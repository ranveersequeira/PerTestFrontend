## Why TailwindCSS?

1.Flexibilty - You can build any custom design because it follows utility first design rather than traditional Bootstrap like classes.
2.Naming Things - I had a lot of instances where i confuse classes names in my project.
3.Maintainbility - When working in team, predefined classes of tailwind helps a alot.
